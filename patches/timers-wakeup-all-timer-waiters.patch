Subject: [PATCH] timers: wakeup all timer waiters

The base lock is dropped during the invocation if the timer. That means
it is possible that we have one waiter while timer1 is running and once
this one finished, we get another waiter while timer2 is running. Since
we wake up only one waiter it is possible that we miss the other one.
This will probably heal itself over time because most of the time we
complete timers without an active wake up.
To avoid the scenario where we don't wake up all waiters at once,
wake_up_all() is used.
